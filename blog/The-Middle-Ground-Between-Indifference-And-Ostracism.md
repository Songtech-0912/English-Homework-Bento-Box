# Finding the middle ground between Indifference and Ostracism

Right now, the free/libre software community has become overwhelmed with codes of conduct.

If you've watched the channel Distrotube, you've most definitely heard about Derek Taylor's gripes about GNOME's Code of Conduct. Taylor points out, rightly, that there are many issues with the GNOME CoC. Among the controversial sticking points.

The solution he endorses? It's called the no code of conduct.

He claims that we are "clothed with psychological fraud", and essentially that people are selfish beings, and feelings are unimportant (generalization).

Take StackOverflow as an example. It is not hard to see how a site with very high standards of quality and professionalism can become, in the eyes of many, a hotbed for elitism.

But we are a community that . Both sides have good points. Both sides are right, in some sense.


And we are doing something too much - ignoring the other side. Just because our side is a lot of good points does not mean it has no fault whatsoever.

So, what's my solution? It is the Sensible Code of Conduct.


It is built on something other than indifference and ostracism. It is built on respect.


And give some credit to the other side. Show that they have a point as well. Be humane and respectful in your responses.
