      <h1>Persepolis Bento</h1>
      <p class="lead">Artistic choices I made for my book bento, explained.</p>
      <p>I know that both my format and presentation of my book bento is unorthrodox (and perhaps a bit overwhelming). However, these were artistical choices I made intentionally.</p>
      <p>As with any book bento, every object in my own (which I will be refering to as "Persepolis" from now on) contains symbolism from <i>Persepolis</i>. The number of objects is subject to interpretation, but the main objects include the Shah of Iran, the Iranian Revolution, the press and the army.</p>
      <p>When looking at "Persepolis", we first notice the massive crowds spread around the book. These are evidently protestors, demonstrating against the Shah and pleading for him to leave. There are a variety of age groups and genders involved in the protest, which reflects the participation of all classes of society within the Iranian Revolution in 1979.The crowd seems disorganized and random, yet also homogenous and united; this is much like the image shown on the top panel of page 18 in <i>Persepolis</i>.</p>
      <p>Located to the left are the ruins of Persepolis. Although Persepolis was not the actual capital of Iran during the Pahlavi Dynasty's reign, I included it as a reference to the imaginary seat of power of the Shah. As we see it deserted, we can infer that the Shah is losing his power and no longer intends to continue as Shah.</p>
      <p>In the bottom left hand corner, we can see the Shah and Shahbanu of Iran. They are facing away from the people of Iran, which suggests both that the Shah figuratively "turned his back" on the Iranian people, and that he is fleeing from the Iran as he sees huge crowds pursuing him. Their departure was directly inspired by the bottom right panel on page 41, and their miniscule size shows how the Shah has only a fraction of the power that he had originally.</p>
      <p>In the right of the image, there is a newspaper, which symbolizes the press during the Iranian revolution. In <i>Persepolis</i>, we see the importance of the press mentioned several times; the first detailed description of the Iran-Iraq War when it is announced on the news (Page 84-85), and a single newspaper has a profound impact on Marji (Page 70).</p>
      <p>Lastly, the military vehicles in the scene represent the Iranian military. The army initially followed the Shah's orders, and suppressed protests, as shown on the far right; but then began to turn against the Shah, marching alongside protestors. After the Revolution, they still had a major role, which included inforcing Islamic Law and fighting against Iraq in the War. I made a specific choice to only show American military equipment, which were what which most of Iran's armed forces were equipped with. </p>
      <p>My overall aim of this illustration was to showcase the world described in <i>Persepolis</i> as a panorama of everyone involved. All of the individual elements all surround the central element-the book <i>Persepolis</i> itself. Though I could not use every single character and location in the book, I tried to provide a comprehensive picture of what is happening, right at the midpoint of <i>Persepolis's</i> plot.</p>
      <p>As a note, doing everything digitally was my way of creating art that could not be realized in real life. And-yes-I know that I am not using Times New Roman, and font size 12, because artwork should be alive and with expressive typography, rather than with bland and monotonous standard forms.</p>
